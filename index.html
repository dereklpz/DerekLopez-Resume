        <div class="subheading mb-5">SociologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Derek Lopez, I come from a small town called Calexico in California. I am a freshman at UCR, and I am majoring in Sociology. I am looking forward to taking on the challenge that is college and life itself. I will be trying to go for my bachelors in four years and later applying to be part of the Border Patrol Agency. I am a athlete, that has played baseball and basketball for a good part of his life. Those two sports play a huge part in me. . <br><br>

        Baseball was my first passion and the sport I have played since I was three years old. Baseball has taught me so many valuable lessons and has given me the privilege of being able to travel across the globe playing the sport I love. I got the humbling experience of being able to come out and represent Mexico in the world series in 2015 which was televised in ESPN. I got to play this sport all the way up to my junior year in high school. This year was the year that thought me a very valuable experience. I got injured. An injury that prevented me from playing at the level I wanted. The lesson I was taught was to not take things for granted. It taught me that whenever I do something, I should be live and do what I do to the very best of my abilities because I never know when is the last time I will have the privilege of doing that. Basketball the sport that I never knew I needed. A sport I became a part of late in my short life. I became in love with this sport at the beginning of high school. Coming from being an all-star in baseball I was now coming into a new sport where nobody knew my name. This taught me to be humble. To do what the team needed me to do. For the first three years of high school I was a role player, was not the star I once was. Until my senior year, I was named co-captain because of the hard work I had done the years before. This, a sport I had to work extra hard for every accomplishment. I got to finish my high school career with a championship, and it taught me about family. It taught me to rely on others even when I did not think I need it. These two sports I played were more than a hobby, they were life lessons throughout the experiences and bonds I built with all the teams and teammates I played with. <br><br>

        For the future, this is something that I will take into my career. My background in sports and teamwork is something I am going to try to do with the career I choose. It helped me build knowledge on what it takes and what it means to be a leader to others.  I look forward to all the challenges that will come my way. I aspire to become successful at whatever career I decide to follow. I know that with my experience in leadership and teamwork I can build strong relationships with colleagues that will help me be successful at what I do.
